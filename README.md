# Legacy Bnb Chain Extension Wallet (V2)

This repository provides the V2 version of the BNB Chain Wallet extension for Chrome and Firefox. As the V2 version is being phased out in favor of V3 (bew-lite), which has limited functionality, some users may still need V2 for features like token recovery or other purposes. Here, you can download and manually install the V2 extension.

**Note**: The V2 extension is no longer officially supported. Use it at your own risk.
